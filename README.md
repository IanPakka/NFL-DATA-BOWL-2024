The goal of this project was to help NFL offensive coordinators and players to better understand when to run and pass the ball. The model attempts to analyze the players 
positions prior to the snap. This picks up on defensive players making adjustments and how they line up. The data is broken down by team to try and account for the differences
in team dynamics. Overall This project is still in its initial phases however I plan to continue experimenting with feature engineering and different models such as nueral networks.
